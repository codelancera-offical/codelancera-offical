## Find Friends

As far as I have experienced, people who share my interestsâ€”or even just a subsetâ€”are really, really rare.  
But I believe there must be others like me in this world, and I will never give up searching for them.  

If you satisfy **at least one** of the following conditions, please, please contact meâ€”I really want to be friends with you, and I bet you will want to as well:

- You can feel something that others cannot in **Math, Philosophy, or Music**.
- You are curious about **Physics**, but also care about things **BEYOND Physics**.
- You are also a **PKMER**.
- You are deeply interested in **HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS**.  
- You are not just satisfied with learning popular AI techniquesâ€”you want to build an AI with a **REAL SOUL**.
